This is a repository of raw data used to generate the plots in Ault-McCoy et al., *Optimizing superlattice bilayer graphene for a fractional Chern insulator*, 
arXiv:2505.05551. The data is stored in compressed binary numpy files (generated with numpy v2.2) in the `raw` directory. The plots can be generated by running
`python make_plots.py` in the root of this directory. Requires Python 3.10 or greater, numpy, and matplotlib. The plots will be output in the `plots` directory.
